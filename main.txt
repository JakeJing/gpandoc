# Introduction
This is an introduction [@Kemmerer2012]. 
\begin{exe} \ex Expectation-based facilitation in German \label{ex-german}
\begin{xlist}
\ex \gll Er hat das Buch, [das Lisa gestern gekauft hatte], hingelegt.\\
         he has the book that Lisa yesterday bought had laid.down\\
\ex  \gll Er hat das Buch hingelegt, [das Lisa gestern gekauft hatte].\\
        he has the book laid.down that Lisa yesterday bought had\\
       \glt ‘He has laid down the book that Lisa had bought yesterday.’ 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


In self-paced reading, the verb is read faster in such examples when it follows the semantically rich and complex noun phrase in \ref{ex-german}a (“the book that Lisa bought yesterday”) than when it follows the short object noun phrase “the book” in \ref{ex-german}b, where the relative clause is extraposed. Since these facilitation effects matter most for long and information-rich dependents, one would expect less variation in placement with longer dependencies (long→head-final→less variable).

We predict the direction and variation of each word order in a model assuming a Beta-Binomial likelihood function. The Beta-Binomial distribution is a mixture of a Binomial and a Beta distribution.^[This is my footnote.] It generalizes the Binomial distribution, and can capture overdispersion. With the Beta-Binomial model, the Binomial probability is randomly drawn from a Beta distribution $\mathbf{B}\left(\alpha, \beta \right)$ with hyperparameters $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$. 


\begin{equation*}
\text{Beta2} \left(\mu, \phi \right) = \text{Beta} \left(\alpha = \frac{\mu}{\phi}, \beta = \frac{\left(1 - \mu \right)}{\phi} \right)
\end{equation*}


# Results
